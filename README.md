# CodeRipple Test Repository

This repository is designed specifically for testing the CodeRipple automated code analysis system.

## Purpose
- Validate end-to-end pipeline functionality
- Test real AI analysis with Strands + Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Demonstrate CodeRipple capabilities

## Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point with core functionality
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for analysis depth
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Expected Analysis
This repository should trigger comprehensive AI analysis including:
- Code structure analysis
- Function documentation
- Dependency analysis
- Architecture insights

## Testing Workflow
1. Push changes to trigger CodeRipple webhook
2. Monitor pipeline execution across all components
3. Validate analysis results in Showroom
4. Check event logging in Cabinet

**CodeRipple Webhook**: Configured to analyze this repository automatically on push events.


## Pipeline Testing

This change triggers the CodeRipple end-to-end pipeline test.

**Test Timestamp**: Tue Jul  1 15:16:28 NZST 2025
**Expected Flow**: GitHub webhook â†’ Receptionist â†’ Analyst â†’ Deliverer â†’ Showroom


**Integration Fix Applied**: Tue Jul  1 15:22:30 NZST 2025
- API Gateway now properly integrated with Receptionist Lambda
- Webhook should trigger complete pipeline


## End-to-End Pipeline Test

**Test Execution**: Tue Jul  1 15:37:24 NZST 2025
**Objective**: Validate complete CodeRipple workflow
**Expected Flow**: 
1. GitHub webhook â†’ Receptionist (repo cloning)
2. Receptionist â†’ EventBridge â†’ Analyst (AI analysis)  
3. Analyst â†’ EventBridge â†’ Deliverer (results packaging)
4. Results delivered to Showroom
5. All events logged in Cabinet
